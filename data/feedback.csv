2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Good to learn that you can do loops in the command line; didn't know that before."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"For loops were explained very well.  Section was interesting."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Loop was very interesting."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"The challenges.  Exercises are engaging."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Having helpers around is very important otherwise I'd definitely be lost."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Easy to follow.  Loved seeing commands on the screen.  Exercises were helpful.  Shorcuts were great to learn."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"It was helpful to type out all the commands with the instructor to get a better idea of how the program works."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Great explanations of functionality of different operators."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Learning basic Linux commands in a formal setting was very helpful and will save time in future."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"I liked how everyone could follow along.  Other people's questions helped me too."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Explained very clearly.  Got to try it on your own."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Step by step instruction."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"I like the explanations of what each command is and what is is doing / what it means."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Interactive activities have been very helpful.  I especially feel like the pipe examples were very clear."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Liked the teaching style using exercises, especially using files in different places to practice navigation."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Easy to follow.  Content is simple and straight forward.  I can actually learn useful things in workshop (sic)."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"I liked learning using the shell commands because I use the shell a lot and didn't know some shortcuts i.e. ctrl+a."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Learning how to use unix to navigate and create files.  Using word count and sort, head, tail, functions to display data in a convenient way.  Liked the exercises to check I know what I am diong."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"I liked following along and watching someone else do actual code.  Access to the lessons and problems are helpful."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"The exercises are a very useful / effective way to learn the commands."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"I am really enjoying this workshop as I never learned coding before so anything is better than nothing.  However from a learning perspective I really like the green and red post-it idea as I think that was pretty clever."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Great crash course on Unix command line.  It was a good revision for those who are familiar with the content."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Challenge problems.  Software Carpentry website with all notes.  Green and red post-it system.  Instructor walking through each line and what all symbols mean."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Everything, including the pace, has been great so far."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Nice explanation of the material.  Good UI."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"The tutorial was easy to follow.  I came in with no background in computer science but I was still able to follow along.  Thank you."
2019-06-13 12:00,green,"Jupyter notebook is awesome.  Shared Carpentries pad.  Examples from GitHub.  Going over basic commands."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Some abbreviations I still don't get.  I know I an Google / check the manual but it would be nice if there was more reiteration of what the '$' is, or what '..' vs '.' does.  I don't get the real world application of some of this; to be fair though I know nothing about computer science."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Would like more background on what is the Shell vs Python."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"I wish there was more information on what the Unix shell is used for in daily practice and how it could be applicable to me."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Can't see the bottom of the screen from the back of the room; harder to follow."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Would have liked more context behind what we were doing."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Many terms and computer talk used that may be foreign to others.  Also what is the significance of this stuff?"
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Not detailed enough when talking about loops; got lost figuring out what the loop is doing."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Don't understand '|' vs '>' vs '>>' very well; might need to go more in detail with that."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Maybe do more exercises and quicker, or do them together."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"I don't like how it was hard to see what was being input because it was at the bottom of the screen."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Clear more often.  Move window up; can't see what you are typing.  More context: what is a directory / are these files actually on my computer?  Alsi is this python another program?"
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"echo doesn't need '' even when space is involved."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Maybe give some more time for explanations."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"We went a bit slow at times on topics that were relatively easy to understand (basic commands)."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"The most basic things can be gone through faster or skipped."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Sometimes it went too fast and got a little confusing."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Some commands glossed over too quicky and hard to follow."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"As someone with no coding experience, some of it went a little fast, and I could have used more actuall recall."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Really still unsure about the remove functions and accidentally deleting files / directories.  Go slower and more examples."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"The pacing was overall slow; could spend less time on the exercises."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"I think having a 'cheat sheet' with the basic commands would have made the beginning go faster.  Doing larger problems / utilizing more commands at once would have better facilitated my understanding of how to use them.  Would have liked to learn how to write scripts using notepad."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Pace was a bit too slow in the beginning and rushed at the end."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"Want to cover everything."
2019-06-13 12:00,red,"It's moving pretty quickly but I've been okay so far.  Maybe incorporate more real world applications of what this could be used for."
