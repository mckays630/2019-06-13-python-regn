2019-06-13 PM,green,"Structured."
2019-06-13 PM,green,"Syntax was explained really well.  Speed was good.  Instructor was well informed."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"A little repetitive.  The pace could be faster."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"No real complaints; maybe a tad repetitive, but some people really need that for the information to truly sink in."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"It was hard for a beginner to follow along."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Maybe summary at the end of each section?"
2019-06-13 PM,red,"I feel like I didn't learn a lot yet."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Speak up; the back can't hear."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Sometimes pace was too fast.  Sometimes couldn't see typing in the command line."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"I got a little confused on the section about dataframes.  I feel like I missed some essential context that I only understood at the end."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Good pace, however, give more time in between steps to allow people who have never coded to get through the step as well."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Wish we were told ways of applying the knowledge we learned to increase interest in the subject."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Nothing negative to say."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Can teach a little bit slower for beginners."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"A little bit faster."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Fast paced."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Went too fast when typing on screen."
2019-06-13 PM,red,"Was sometimes hard to keep up with code on screen since it was too zoomed in the text disappeared very quickly."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Pace was good.  Well explained."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Good pace.  Clear explanations.  Really enjoyed 'visualizing the gapminder data'."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Explanations were clear and examples were very helpful.  Liked how you showed multiple ways and situations."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Pace is better today than yesterday :)"
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Playing with plotting was fun."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Good pace.  Good challenges."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Good pace.  Easy to follow.  Very informative."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Better speed.  Good engagement."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"Fun customisable examples."
2019-06-14 AM,green,"I believe the pace was perfect.  Information was conveyed well."
2019-06-14 AM,red,"No complaints."
2019-06-14 AM,red,"No problems"
2019-06-14 AM,red,"Ravi: not mmuch clarity about when everyone has reached a consensus.  I fell behind building graphs and I lost track right before lunch.  Samir: at this point I know how to create basic functions and asking to make a celcius to kelvin functionv felt too slow; same with vector and matrix math."
2019-06-14 AM,red,"Make sure we can see your code as much as possible; don't scroll too fast."
2019-06-14 AM,red,"I liked when we were given time to experiment with the graph features, but I wish we had more time to experiment with everything else."
2019-06-14 AM,red,"Wish yesterday was a bit faster and today was slower."
2019-06-14 AM,red,"During plotting maybe going a little slower for syntax would have been better."
2019-06-14 AM,red,"I wish we could have done more with visualizing data."
2019-06-14 AM,red,"Switched between code and graphs too quickly to finish copying and understanding code."
